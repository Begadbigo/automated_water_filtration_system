# Automated Water Filtration System for Slaughterhouse Wastewater
*Capstone project in STEM October 11th district schhols for Grade 11, Semester 1*

A hardware-based solution that automates the purification of wastewater from slaughterhouses using natural filtration materials, sensors, and Arduino-controlled pumps. The system makes the water suitable for agricultural use.

## Project Overview

It uses a multi-stage filtration process enhanced by sensors and automated hardware to monitor and improve water quality. The system is built and tested as a working prototype with real components.

The project includes:
- A natural filtration design using salts and organic materials.
- Automated control via Arduino, using real-time water quality feedback.
- Documentation through scientific poster, portfolio, and circuit design.

## Hardware Components

The circuit includes the following components:
- **Arduino UNO**
- **2 H-Bridge Motor Drivers (L298N)**
- **4x DC Water Pumps (3â€“6V)**
- **TDS Sensor** (for measuring total dissolved solids)
- **Turbidity Sensor** (for detecting water clarity)
- **Breadboard**
- **Jumper Wires**

These components are connected to control the water flow through multiple filtration stages based on sensor readings.

## Files Included

- `Project's Poster.pdf`: Scientific poster summarizing the entire project.
- `Project's Portfolio.pdf`: Detailed report including prototype materials, design rationale, testing, and results.
- `circuit.jpg`: Circuit layout showing all hardware connections.
- `media/`: Folder containing images and other media files documenting the project.
- *(Code will be added soon)*

## Media

You can find images, and other media in the [`media/`](./media) folder to better understand the system's physical setup.

## Usage

This project is intended for educational and research purposes. It demonstrates how IoT and embedded systems can contribute to solving environmental and agricultural challenges.

## My Role

I designed and built the electronic circuit, handled sensor integration and motor control, and actively participated in constructing and optimizing the natural filtration system. This included selecting suitable materials, prototyping the filter stages, and ensuring the automation system worked effectively with real-time water quality feedback.

## Status

- Hardware prototype tested and functional.
- Scientific documentation complete.
- Source code to be added soon.
